. *Relapse-related genes and their interactinos in breast cancer* \n
  Analyzed gene expression datasets to understand biological pathways and decide treatment strategy. We utilized the logistic-accelerated failure time (AFT) mixture regression model (Chen et al., 2013) to analyze the distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) time associated with gene expression levels.
. *Association between NGS-SNP and overall survival in HR-positive breast cancer patients* \n
  Detected significantly related SNPs in single-locus association analysis with logistic regression test. The results of survival analysis revealed the close association SNPs with survival of breast cancer patients.
. *Statistical methodology development* \n
  Developed a simulation-based approach and applied to the clinical trial of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
. *PCOS trial [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00172523 NCT00172523]* \n
  Contributed to design clinical trial protocols and analyzed clinical data.
. *GENIUS study [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01579630 NCT01579630]* \n
  Analyzed survival data in a multiple regression of the Cox model. The results were presented in American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in 2015.
. *Circulating tumor cells with colorectal cancer* \n
  Determined an optimal cut-off point in ROC analysis as the best experimental condition for the clinical study.
. *In-house website construction for calculating sample sizes* \n
  Worked with colleagues on building an in-house website for sample size calculations in a variety of designs.
